\section{Incoherent Scatter Spectra Calculation}
The incoherent scatter spectra of a plasma is calculated using: % Eventually put citations for all of this stuff here as I learn more about ISR
\begin{equation}
		S(\omega, \mathbf{k}) = 2 \bigg| 1 - \frac{\chi_e}{\epsilon} \bigg|^2 M_e
						+ 2 \bigg| \frac{\chi_e}{\epsilon} \bigg|^2 \sum_i M_i,
\end{equation}
where $M_s$ is the modified distribution function for species $s$,
$\chi_s$ is the susceptability, 
and $\epsilon$ is the dielectric function. 
The dielectric function is 


Discussion here of the pole integrator I've been working on. 
Put a reference to the appendix for all of the testing that's been done with this integrator
